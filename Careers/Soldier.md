# Soldier

In your formative years, you fought tirelessly in skirmishes and campaigns against enemy forces. In defining your career, think about the following questions:

-   Which army and company did you serve?
-   What conflicts were you a part of?
-   What rank did you achieve?
-   What heroics did you perform in the heat of battle?

You gain the following career benefits:

-   **Skills**: One skill from each of the exploration skill group and the intrigue skill group
-   **Languages**: Two languages
-   **Renown**: 1
-   **Title**â€”Drill Sergeant: At the start of a group test or montage test, you can spend a hope token. If you do, all participants make tests as if they also had your exploration skills.
