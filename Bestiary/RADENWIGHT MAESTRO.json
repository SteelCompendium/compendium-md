    "Gravity Well (3 VP)": "A time raider acting this turn can activate gravity well on a square they move through while using a move action. The gravity well lasts until the end of the encounter or until a creature who can reach the well uses a maneuver to disable it. Each square within 4 squares of the gravity well is difficult terrain for non-time raiders, and any non-time raider who ends their turn in such a square is pulled 4 squares toward the well.",

    "Psi-Cage (7 VP)": "All time raiders in the encounter create a psionic field over the encounter map, which lasts until the time raider with the highest Stamina maximum drops to Stamina 0 or chooses to end the field. While the field is up, each non-time raider on the map must make a Reason resistance roll against this psionic effect at the start of each round.",
