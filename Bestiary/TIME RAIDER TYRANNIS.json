They are created brainwashed and indoctrinated to carry out the vile orders of Ajax, a tyrant who wants to rule the world. Check in with your players before running war dogs to make sure that they\u2019re okay with battling these brainwashed soldiers with an appearance akin to Frankenstein\u2019s monster if he were built to be a shock troop. If anyone is uncomfortable, modify the appearance and lore of the war dogs as you see fit.\n\nAjax\u2019s War Dogs\u2014brutal patchwork soldiers\u2014owe their new lives to the Iron Saint, and fight for him fanatically. War Dog minions are the freshest recruits, possessing minimal patchwork qualities and generally treated as disposable. Those who survive a battle are rewarded with gifts from the Body Banks. Those who don\u2019t survive become material for those Body Banks.\n\n### WAR DOG LANGUAGES\n\nMost war dogs speak Caelian and one Vaslorian human language.\n\n### WAR DOG VILLAIN POWER\n\nAt the start of any war dog\u2019s turn, you can spend VP to activate one of the following features:\n\n- **Reconstitut (3 VP):** One war dog acting this turn tears apart a nearby corpse of a humanoid and incorporates its body parts into their own. The war dog regains Stamina equal to 5 times their level.\n\n- **Fire for Effect (5 VP):** A war dog acting this turn can use the following maneuver.\n\n**Fire for Effect (Maneuver)** \u25c6 AGL RR \u25c6 12 VP\n**Keywords**: Area, Magic, Ranged, Resistance\n**Distance**: 5 cube within 10\n**Target**: Each creature"
