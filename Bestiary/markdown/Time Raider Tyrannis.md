## WAR DOGS

> ### CONTENT WARNING: BRAINWASHING AND BODY HORROR
>
> War dogs are explicitly evil soldiers built from the body parts of various humans. They are created brainwashed and indoctrinated to carry out the vile orders of Ajax, a tyrant who wants to rule the world. Check in with your players before running war dogs to make sure that they’re okay with battling these brainwashed soldiers with an appearance akin to Frankenstein’s monster if he were built to be a shock troop. If anyone is uncomfortable, modify the appearance and lore of the war dogs as you see fit.

Ajax’s War Dogs—brutal patchwork soldiers—owe their new lives to the Iron Saint, and fight for him fanatically. War Dog minions are the freshest recruits, possessing minimal patchwork qualities and generally treated as disposable. Those who survive a battle are rewarded with gifts from the Body Banks. Those who don’t survive become material for those Body Banks.

### WAR DOG LANGUAGES

Most war dogs speak Caelian and one Vaslorian human language.
