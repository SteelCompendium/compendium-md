## GOBLINS

As with all humanoid ancestries, different types of goblins and goblin cultures can be found across many lands, each with their own ideals. Known among themselves as **rogabrin**, meaning “more of us” in their language, goblins are one of the most numerous humanoids in the world. They can be found in every environment humans occupy and in places many other humanoids avoid, including deep cave systems.

Their long arms and prehensile toes make goblins particularly well adapted to environments requiring climbing, and they live equally comfortably in treetop cities as in subterranean realms filled with stalactites, ledges, and chasms. However, just as many prefer to dwell in tight-knit neighborhoods within diverse cities. Many of those goblins who cross swords with adventuring heroes are the worst of their society—thieves and murderers shunned by their own people.

### ENCOUNTERED IN GROUPS

Whether within a society or living in exile, goblins survive and thrive because they work together. A single goblin forced into the wild is terrified. A dozen outlaw goblins are supremely confident—perhaps overly so. Such groups often become bandits who ambush travelers crossing through their territory, be it desert, forest, or underground. Larger bands might become unscrupulous mercenaries serving powerful villains. No matter how they’re encountered, goblins prefer to fight as an overwhelming force and to flee when foes outnumber friends.

### MOBILE AND SNEAKY

Short, lithe, and long-armed, goblins are built for mobility, stealth, and climbing. Goblins who dwell in untamed wilderness and twisting caves utilize their natural agility to hide from threats and flee when found. These crafty skirmishers might run wild through battle, hacking at their enemies’ knees, or unleash arrows as they dart from tree to tree.

### GOBLIN MAGIC

Some exiled goblins forge pacts with evil entities for magical power, including archfey, deities, and fiends. Goblin assassins conjure darkness made from the souls of their victims, while goblin cursespitters hurl magic hexes that keep their enemies at bay.

### SKITTERLING

A six-legged winged rodent the size of a housecat, a skitterling moves their clawed feet as they fly, making them appear to scurry through the air. Goblins train these pets to claw at the faces of enemies, as their feet secrete a toxin that causes temporary sluggishness.

### WAR SPIDER

Goblins ride enormous arachnids as mounts in battle. With blades attached to their legs, a war spider cuts a swath through enemy forces while archers fire from atop a platform on the beast’s back. During a raid, a spider arches their body to launch warriors off their back and into the fray.

### WARG

Some goblins form a special bond with wargs—canine creatures that many goblin communities raise as mounts, guardians, and companions.

### GOBLIN LANGUAGES

Most goblins speak Caelian and Szetch.

### GOBLIN VILLAIN POWER

At the start of any goblin’s turn, you can spend VP to activate one of the following features.

- **Goblin Mode (3 VP):** Each goblin in the encounter gains a +2 bonus to speed until the end of the round.

- **Tiny Stabs (5 VP):** Each enemy in the encounter takes 1 damage for each goblin who is adjacent to them.

- **Swamp Stink (7 VP):** The encounter map becomes covered in a green mist that lasts until the end of the round, and which can’t be dispersed by wind. All areas of the map become difficult terrain for non-goblins, and each non-goblin on the map must make a Might resistance roll.

  - ✦ ≤11: 5 poison; weakened until mist disappears
  - ★ 12–16: Weakened until mist disappears
  - ✸ 17+: No effect
