## RADENWIGHTS

Small, agile, and hardy, radenwights have the appearance of humanoid rodents. They’re often referred to as “ratfolk,” a name they don’t particularly mind but also don’t embrace. Should anyone ask, many radenwights speak of being a ratfolk when they’re alone, but always a radenwight when part of a group. Radenwight groups proudly call themselves a “meddle,” and have a knack for appearing where others hoped they wouldn’t or whenever they are least expected. Radenwight meddles can be found in the wilderness as easily as in any city, so long as there’s suitable work and excitement to keep the members of the meddle occupied.

If radenwights’ enemies expect them to scurry away like rats, they will be painfully surprised to see the combined arrows, bodies, and blades of a meddle thrown against them all at once. Whatever radenwights do, they do it fearlessly, with deeply cherished values of bravery and fair play shining through in even the most rakish and roguish of them. Radenwights aren’t above banditry if it will support the meddle, but they greatly prefer to overwhelm, knock down, and knock out their targets rather than engage in deadly violence. They prefer weapons of precision, and look for opportunities to strike as they and their comrades create openings for one another.

### BONDS AND BRAVADO

It’s a big world out there for a bunch of small ratfolk, and radenwights learned long ago that trying to survive by running away or climbing to safety only gets you so far. Radenwights learn boldness from birth and are taught to hurl themselves fearlessly against any challenge that stands in their way. The key to this bravery is the intense bond of trust that exists between every radenwight, their comrades, and their community, and the knowledge that every other radenwight will act just as decisively as they do. In a scrap, it’s not one radenwight’s blade or arrow that brings down the foe, but the instant and instinctual follow-up from their fellows.

### THE MAGIC OF MUSIC

The pursuit of arcane studies is unusual among radenwights, though the community throws their support behind any child who happens to show that talent. Somewhat more common is the spontaneous discovery of magical aptitude through music, as the culture of radenwight meddles strongly emphasizes both music and dance. Radenwights are particularly drawn to flutes and panpipes, inspired by the legend of a flutist who enraptured an evil dragon while her meddle lined up a suitably sized boulder to be dropped from the cliff above.

### RADENWIGHT LANGUAGES

Most radenwights speak Caelian and Szetch.

### RADENWIGHT VILLAIN POWER

At the start of any radenwight’s turn, you can spend VP to activate one of the following features.

**Trouser Cut (3 VP)**
A non-minion radenwight can use the following ability.

**Trouser Cut (Action)** ◆ 2d10 + 2
Keywords: Attack, Melee, Weapon
Distance: Reach 1
Target: One creature

- ✦ ≤11: 5 damage; push 3
- ★ 12–16: 10 damage; push 3; [[Taunted|taunted]] (EoT)
- ✸ 17+: 12 damage; push 3; [[Taunted|taunted]] (REA ends)
  Effect: If a target is wearing clothing covering the lower half of their body, they must use a maneuver to pull that clothing up before they can move.

**Rat Race (5 VP)**
Each radenwight shifts up to their speed. Wherever a radenwight ends this movement adjacent to at least one other radenwight, they can make a melee [[Free Strike|free strike]] against a target.

**Wall of Rats (7 VP)**
A 10-foot wall of living rats scurrying atop one another in a coordinated manner appears in unoccupied spaces anywhere on the encounter map and lasts until the end of the encounter. The wall doesn’t block line of effect for radenwights and their allies, but it does for other creatures, as the rats coordinate their movements with the radenwights. Each square of the wall has 10 Stamina. If the last radenwight in the encounter dies and the wall is still standing, the rats let out a hideous screech as they disperse. Each enemy on the encounter map must then make an Intuition resistance roll.

- ✸ ≤11: 10 sonic damage
- ★ 12–16: 5 sonic damage
- ✦ 17+: No effect
