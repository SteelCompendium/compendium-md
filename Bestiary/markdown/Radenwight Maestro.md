## TIME RAIDERS

The kuran’zoi (coor-AN-zoy), also called time raiders, are humanoids who make the astral realm of the Sea of Stars their home. Many kuran’zoi make their living as guides for travelers from other planes, while others survive on the Sea of Stars through piracy against interplanar vessels.

### VETERANS OF THE PSYCHIC WARS

Thousands of years ago, the synlirii—a powerful species of evil psionic aberrations—created the kuran’zoi as soldiers. But as the synlirii experimented with and enhanced these warriors’ psionic potential, the kuran’zoi came to understand the true nature of their progenitors. They rebelled against the synlirii and fled to the Sea of Stars, becoming nomads of the timescape.

### HARDENED-VISION HEXAPODS

Kuran’zoi possess resilient ocular sensors that allow them to see in the dark. Knowing these sensors would also defend them against the hardlight storms of the astral realm, the escaping kuran’zoi chose the Sea of Stars as their home. They thrive where the winds of limbo roar. Time raiders also have two sets of arms, allowing them to wield melee weapons at the same time as ranged weapons. A single well-trained kuran’zoi is like a squad unto themself.

### PSI-TECH

Like their synlirii foes, time raiders travel on mindships and wield psionic weapons and tools that only their people can activate. Many kuran’zoi specialize in melee weapons that psionically devastate enemies, but time raider vertexes also learn to pilot enormous suits of psionic armor that empower their allies.

### GENRE RAIDERS

The moniker “time raider” is imprecise. Rather, when kuran’zoi raid a world of the timescape that relies on sorcery instead of kuran’zoi technology—including Orden—it seems to those worlds’ people as though the time raiders have come from the future, wielding marvelous weapons of light that hit as hard as steel.

### LEAVE A FEW ALIVE

Time raider pirates plunder the vessels they target, but allow just enough of the crew to survive so the ship can make it back home. Kuran’zoi pirate captains often remind their crews: “Leave the sheep alive. Next year, they’ll return with a new coat of wool for us to shear.”

### CREATURES OUTSIDE TIME

While in the Sea of Stars, time raiders and other creatures don’t age. As a result, many living kuran’zoi recall the Psychic Wars. They carry the lessons learned from millennia of conflict with the synlirii into new battles with devastating effect, using mindships to launch attacks on other planes and appearing exactly where they want to. However, this knowledge serves them far beyond war. Time raiders raise their young in ruined citadels and similar strongholds on obscure worlds, keeping their creches secret and protected.

### TIME RAIDER LANGUAGES

Most time raiders speak Caelian and Voll.

### TIME RAIDER VILLAIN POWER

At the start of any time raider’s turn, you can spend VP to activate one of the following features:

- **Gravity Well (3 VP):** A time raider acting this turn can activate gravity well on a square they move through while using a move action. The gravity well lasts until the end of the encounter or until a creature who can reach the well uses a maneuver to disable it. Each square within 4 squares of the gravity well is difficult terrain for non-time raiders, and any non-time raider who ends their turn in such a square is pulled 4 squares toward the well.
- **Recall Module (5 VP):** Until the end of the round, whenever a time raider ends their turn with movement remaining, they can teleport back to the space where they started their turn (or the closest unoccupied space of their choice), and make a free strike as a free triggered action.
- **Psi-Cage (7 VP):** All time raiders in the encounter create a psionic field over the encounter map, which lasts until the time raider with the highest Stamina maximum drops to Stamina 0 or chooses to end the field. While the field is up, each non-time raider on the map must make a Reason resistance roll against this psionic effect at the start of each round.
