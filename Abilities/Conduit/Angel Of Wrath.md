**Effect:** You summon an angelic spirit of size 1M who can’t be harmed, and who appears in an unoccupied space within distance. The spirit lasts until the end of your next turn.

The first time on a turn that an enemy moves within 1 square of the spirit or starts their turn there, they take holy damage equal to twice your Intuition score.
